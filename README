this is a distributed network of nodes, that clients can connect to to retrieve files from the system or add new files into the system. a single node consists of both a routing daemon and a webserver.

	rd.c:	routing daemon, figures out where the objects are stored on the system and tells the webserver. Needs a .conf file sothat it can communicate with other nodes, and a .files file to keep track of the local objects 
	webserver.py:	webserver interface to clients. queries the routing daemon,fetches the files from the system and returns them to the client. also, adds files to the local node.


SETUP:

	in /rd directory:
		>Make
		>./rd node.conf node.files
	
	in /starter directory:
		>./webserver.py

	open up web browser and type:
		http://<webserver-IP>:<webserver-PORT>

	NOTE: the webserver-PORT must be the same as the server port number in the first line of the .conf file.
