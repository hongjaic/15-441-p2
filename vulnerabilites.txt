Our system is vulnerable to any kind of bad input. We are nit currently 
filtering user input and are directly putting the user submitted content into 
the url requests. for example, if a user submitted a field-name such as "a&b=c" 
then our system would send a request with uri:
	?object=a&b=c
if we had an element with name 'b' the user just modified it, even though we 
never gave the user the option to.

Our system is currently exposed to the general internet. Any person with the
IP address and port f of our routing daemons can talk to the daemons directly.
This is bad because our system is built on the assumption that Routing Daemons
will only communicate with flask clients. This assumption relies on structured
packets and protocls and if a host sends a "malformed" packet to a Routing
daemon, the daemon will crash pretty hard.
