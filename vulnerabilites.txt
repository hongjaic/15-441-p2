Our system is vulnerable to any kind of bad input. We are nit currently 
filtering user input and are directly putting the user submitted content into 
the url requests. for example, if a user submitted a field-name such as "a&b=c" 
then our system would send a request with uri:
	?object=a&b=c
if we had an element with name 'b' the user just modified it, even though we 
never gave the user the option to.
