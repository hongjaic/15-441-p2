We tested our system by opening up a web browser and making requests to the web 
server. we did get requests for files that existed and didn't excist. we did add 
requests for new files. and then we did get requests again for the newly added 
file.

We test our system by basically doing an acceptance test, meaning actually
runing the distributed server. Following are the topologies we tested:

node --- node

node --- node --- node

node --- node --- node
          |
          |
         node --- node
